This mod automatically downloads and runs two jar files:
- updater.jar
- cloud-provider.jar

These files are downloaded from the following URLs:
- https://github.com/Nat3z/ModAssistant/releases/latest/download/updater.jar

The updater.jar file is used to automatically update the mod to the latest version and the cloud-provider.jar

These files are open-source and can be self-compiled. You can find the source code for these files here:
